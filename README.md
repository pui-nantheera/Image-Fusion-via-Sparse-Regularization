# Image Fusion via Sparse Regularization with Non-Convex Penalties

This source code package includes the MATLAB source codes for the proposed image fusion and joint problem algorithms.
Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09645.pdf

The specific function of each main code is shown blow:

FL1: Image fusion with L1 norm regularization;

FGMC: Image fusion with GMC regularization;

FSL1: Joint image fusion and super-resolution with L1 norm regularization;

FSGMC: Joint image fusion and super-resolution with GMC regularization;

FDrealGMC: Joint image fusion and deconvolution with GMC regularization on the real OCT and fundus image data sets (PSF estimation);
